<h2> Let's make a bar graph with gnuplot </ h2>

Create a bar graph using gnuplot and save it as an image file. The goal is to create the graph below.

<img src = "/ images / chart / 20201129185816_1.png" />

<h3> Install gnuplot </ h3>
You can easily install it on your Mac using Homebrew.

<pre>
$ brew install gnuplot
</ pre>

<h3> Create a bar graph </ h3>

<h4> Prepare the data </ ​​h4>
I saved it with the file name sample-box.dat.
<pre>
1 "2016" 9500
2 "2017" 10800
3 "2018" 11800
4 "2019" 12100
5 "2020" 16600
</ pre>

<h4> Display graph </ h4>
Start gnuplot and display the graph.
If sample-box.dat is not in the current directory, specify the file path.

immediate help: type "help" (plot window: hit'h')

Did you see a bar chart?
I think that the x-axis is displayed from "2016" to "2020", and the y-axis is the value in the third column of sample-box.dat to create a bar graph.

<h4> Save as an image </ h4>

Specify the output destination with set terminal and set output and plot.

<pre>
gnuplot> set terminal png font "Sans, 9"

Terminal type is now'png'
Options are'nocrop enhanced size 640,480 font "Sans, 9.0"'
gnuplot> set output'test-boxes.png'
gnuplot>
gnuplot> plot'sample-box.dat' using 1: 3: xtic (2) with boxes
gnuplot>
</ pre>

Was the graph saved as a test-boxes.png file?
Select a font that can display Japanese in your environment.


<h4> Simplify the output of bar graphs </ h4>
Save the following file as png_plot-boxes.txt.
I also tried to specify the format of the graph.

<pre>
set terminal png font "Sans, 9"
set output'test-boxes.png'
set boxwidth 0.5
set style fill solid
unset key
set title'Sales by year'
set ylabel'(yen)'
#Separation of digits below
set format "%'.0f"
set decimalsign locale; set decimalsign "."

plot [] [0:]'sample-box.dat' using 1: 3: xtic (2) with boxes
</ pre>

You can execute the commands in the file all at once by executing the following.
<pre>
$ gnuplot png_plot-boxes.txt
</ pre>

You can get the same result by starting gnuplot and using the load command.
<pre>
gnuplot> load'png_plot-boxes.txt'
</ pre>

The following image is saved.

<img src = "/ images / chart / 20201129185816_1.png" />
