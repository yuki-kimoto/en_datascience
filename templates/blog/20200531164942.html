<h2> Let's find the minimum value </h2>

I will explain how to find the minimum value using a Perl program.

Let's find the minimum value of the <h3> array. </h3>

Consider an array that contains only positive numbers from 1 to 10, such as:

<pre>
my @array = (8, 1, 3, 5, 7);
</pre>

<h4> Sample program to find the minimum value of an array </h4>
Actually find the minimum value from the array. The <a href="https://perlzemi.com/blog/20080114120030.html"> List :: Util module</a> has a min function, which is not used in this example.
You can find the minimum value by preparing a variable to store the minimum value and comparing it with the elements of the array one by one.
* Since the initial value of the variable that saves the minimum value is set to be compared with the numerical value from 1 to 10 in advance, 99, which is sufficiently large, is set as the initial value.
If you don't know the range of numbers to compare, you need to devise a comparison.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my @array = (8, 1, 3, 5, 7);

my $ min = 99;

for my $ num (@array) {
  if ($ min> $ num) {
    $ min = $ num;
  }
}

print "$ min \ n";
</pre>

Execution result
<pre>
1
</pre>

I think that the process is very easy to understand by comparing each one.
* To simplify the code, we will handle an array that contains only positive numbers from 1 to 10.


<h3> Let's find the minimum value of a specific column from the tabular data. </h3>

Consider the following data that was also used to find the maximum value.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr> <th> name </th> <th> age </th> </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr> <th> bob </th> <th> 9 </th> </tr>
    <tr> <th> tom </th> <th> 14 </th> </tr>
    <tr> <th> alice </th> <th> 11 </th> </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

It is as follows when expressed by the reference of the array and the hash.
<pre>
$ array_ref = [
  {name =>'bob', age => 9},
  {name =>'tom', age => 14},
  {name =>'alice', age => 11}
];;
</pre>

<h4> Sample program to find the minimum value of the age column </h4>
Data access has become a little more difficult due to the complexity of the referenced data,
The method of checking is the same as before.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my $ array_ref = [
  {name =>'bob', age => 9},
  {name =>'tom', age => 14},
  {name =>'alice', age => 11}
];;

my $ min = 99;

for my $ info (@ {$ array_ref}) {
  if ($ min> $ info-> {'age'}) {
    $ min = $ info-> {'age'};
  }
}

print "$ min \ n";
</pre>

Execution result
<pre>
9
</pre>

The process is the same as before except that the reference is dealt with.
