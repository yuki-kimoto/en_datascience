<h2> Let's make a line graph with gnuplot </ h2>

Create a line chart using gnuplot and save it as an image file. The goal is to create the graph below.

<img src = "/ images / chart / 20210325002411_1.png" />

<h3> Prepare gnuplot </ h3>

<h3> Create a line graph </ h3>

<h4> Prepare the data </ ​​h4>
I saved it with the file name sample-line.dat.
<pre>
1 "2016" 2850
2 "2017" 3240
3 "2018" 3540
4 "2019" 3630
5 "2020" 4980
</ pre>

<h4> Save the bar graph as an image </ h4>
Save a file like the following as png_plot-lines.txt.
I also tried to specify the format of the graph.

<pre>
set terminal png font "Sans, 9"
set output'test-line.png'
unset key
set title'Sales by year'
set ylabel'(yen)'
#Separation of digits below
set format "%'.0f"
set decimalsign locale; set decimalsign "."

plot [] [0:]'sample-line.dat' using 1: 3: xtic (2) with lines
</ pre>

Output a line graph with the following command.
<pre>
$ gnuplot png_plot-lines.txt
</ pre>


Did you save the target-like image "test-line.png"?
You can make it a line chart (with lines) by modifying the plot option.
